                        FEM.ALE Brewster Beer Festivals are dedicated to showcasing the creative and innovative work being done by women in the brewing
                        industry. Since 2014 we’ve been running our flagship festival at the Plasterers Arms in Norwich,
                        where we serve nothing but beer brewed by women or with a strong female presence in larger brew teams.
                        We also showcase women in music to take care of the entertainment, launch exclusive one off beers
                        brewed just for the festival, host Meet the Brewster beer tastings and hold discussions with panels
                        of experts of the brewing industry, historians and academics, to provide broader contexts for how
                        our beer and pub cultures work, inviting all who attend to participate with their own experiences
                        too.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Stereotypes around what types of people make and drink beer are pretty well accounted for. We’ve all seen the advertising,
                        the branding, the pump clips and the attitudes that continue to place women out of shot when it comes
                        to buying (or brewing) a pint. To counter this overwhelming discourse, we have, over the past five
                        years, been celebrating the women who are not only part of the beer industry, but really at the forefront
                        of the most exciting new techniques, ideas and experiments in brewing. We’ve expanded to Brighton’s
                        premier queer hub, the Marlborough Pub and Theatre since 2016 and in 2018 took the festival to Bunkers
                        Hill Hockley as part of Nottingham Craft Beer Week. As we’ve been invited to host events and talks
                        at more and more events across the UK and seen the conversation about women in the industry grow,
                        we’re now joining forces with Norwich Craft Beer Week to launch our Inclusivity Campaign, a new initiative
                        for the Fine City on how pubs and bars create spaces where punters and workers can enjoy their time
                        without fear of discrimination based on gender, race, age, disability, sexuality or any other form.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We’re still using our events to make the work of women in the brewing industry visible and valued, encouraging women drinkers
                        to identify with a drink that is so often advertised with a certain brand of masculinity, and now
                        we’re expanding into how the brilliant work of Norwich’s hospitality workers can inform ideas on
                        making more inclusive spaces across the county, the country and the industry as a whole.

                        OLD ABOUT SECTION:

                        FEM.ALE is a festival that showcases female led music and most importantly, beer brewed by women and enjoyed by everyone.
                        Surprisingly, FEM.ALE is the first dedicated brewster festival in the U.K providing a platform to
                        celebrate women in the beer industry through extensive lists of female brewed beer, meet-the-brewers,
                        specially made one-off ales, panels, discussions and all sorts of other events.
                    </p>
                    <p>We get asked a few questions on a regular basis – sometimes from people with genuine inquiries or wanting
                        clarification, sometimes from people being snarky because… well, that’s what you get for pointing
                        out gender inequality.
                    </p>

                    <h4> What counts as a Brewster beer? </h4>
                    <p>
                        All the beers at FEM.ALE are designed, developed and brewed by women or brew teams that are led by women. Most of the breweries
                        we source from are pretty small, so it’s easy to define who’s doing the brewing, as opposed to other
                        jobs such as the accounts or the marketing. At some of the bigger beer companies, it’s harder to
                        tell who’s at the heart of the physical brewing process and the creative design process, so we go
                        to the women in those organisations and ask them what beers they’ve been involved with or which they
                        would recommend in the line-up of beers at the brew co. they work at.
                    </p>

                    <h4> What’s the difference between ‘craft beer’ and ‘real ale’? </h4>
                    <p>
                        Technically, not a lot. Or at least it depends on where you are. As a cultural phenomenon, craft beer emerged out of smaller
                        batch American breweries in the 1990s and 2000s, Sierra Nevada being a brand that used ‘craftiness’
                        to offer an alternative beer identity to those at big beer co’s like Coors or Budweiser to huge commercial
                        success. Here in the UK, thanks to CAMRA and the tireless work of thousands of brewers creating quality
                        small batch beer, real ale breweries were always sort of…doing that anyway. However, while the American
                        term ‘craft’ refers to the smaller volume of beer being produced, over here ‘craft’ refers more to
                        the style. ‘Craft beer’ is often keg bound than barrel aged, is therefore fizzier and stronger American
                        hops are used, giving American style craft beers a different, more pronounced hop flavour than ‘real
                        ale’ does with our slightly less sun-drenched British-grown hops. Rain cloud emoji.
                    </p>
                    <h4> Where are all the women in cider-making?? </h4>
                    <p>
                        We’re working on it!
                    </p>

                    <h4> Are men allowed at the festival (hurr hurr)? </h4>
                    <p>
                        Yes (hurr hurr). We welcome all genders to the party.
                    </p>

                    <h4> Is the beer… different? </h4>
                    <p>
                        Different… to what? If you’re a regular beer drinker, you’re probably already drinking Brewster beers on a regular basis.
                        Our plan is to bring a selection of them together to celebrate women in an industry where we are
                        largely underrepresented.

                    <p>
                        For three days, all of the beer taps at
                        <a href='http://theplasterersarms.co.uk'> The Plasterers Arms </a>will be dedicated to pouring you the finest craft brews in the country, exclusively
                        brewed by women.
                    </p>
                    <h5> ALL WEEK: </h5>
                    <p>
                        There will be a special Fem.Ale stand on the market, in collaboration with Sir Toby’s Beers. Some of the best female-brewed
                        beers will be available to buy in can and bottle for the entire week of city of ale.
                    </p>

                    <h5> SPECIAL FEMALE BREWS: </h5>
                    <p>
                        Once again our friends at some of our favourite fem.ale breweries have pulled out all the stops and made us some extra special
                        one-offs for the festival:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                We have the only cask in existence of Burnt Mill's birthday Triple IPA - a massive peachy hop-bomb at an impressive 11%ABV...
                                on cask!!
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                We have a Mandarina Bavaria single hop beer from the People's Brewery
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Redwell have made a special mango West Coast Pale for us, on cask
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Truman's have made a special version of their citrus pale ale Bow Bells infused with fresh raspberries
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We're also excited to have some beers that might not be unique to us, but really showcase the Fem.Ale theme:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Wild Card Unite Citrus Saison - brewed as part of International Collaborative Women's Brew Day
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Dawn Break - a California Common on cask as part of the Norfolk Broads Brewing range from Humpty Dumpty. THis is a series
                                of collaborations between Lesley at Humpty Dumpty and other women working in the beer and
                                brewing industry in Norfolk. A great project! This beer will also be pouring on our market
                                stand over the festival.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                We also have a top secret beer brewed in London which was a huge collaboration between about 15 female brewers from around
                                the country, but it's under embargo until the weekend of the festival so we can't tell you
                                what!
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <h4> The story so far…</h4>
                    <p>
                        In five years of running FEM.ALE Festival, celebrating women in the brewing industry and showcasing their beers at events
                        in our home town of Norwich, in Brighton, Sheffield and Nottingham, we’ve seen a huge shift in the
                        conversation about women and beer. From encouraging women drinkers to try a selection of beers and
                        break down stereotypes around who drinks what, to making the creative and cultural labour of women
                        in brewing visible, people across the country have been sharing their experiences, knowledge and
                        enthusiasm for a beer and pub culture that puts diversity at the forefront.

                        Now that so many people are talking about women in brewing, we wanted to start a new conversation about how to make pubs
                        and bars as safe and inclusive as possible. There are some great initiatives encouraging drinking
                        establishments to display a zero tolerance policy on discriminatory language so that everyone feels
                        safe and happy while enjoying a pint (or anything else for that matter) and there are pubs, such
                        as our headquarters The Plasterers Arms, that have displayed such a policy for years now. But, as
                        anyone who has ever worked in hospitality knows, enforcing this type of policy is often easier said
                        than done. What does this policy really mean for bartenders, managers and punters?

                    </p>
                    When does a bartender step in and say that something is unacceptable and? What might it mean for workers in chain pubs where
                    procedural policy comes from a central office? What responsibility do workers feel to upholding a policy
                    when their shifts are unreliable, they’re working late nights for minimum wage and there isn’t a security
                    presence? How much do workers feel at risk when trying to step in to a conversation that they deem offensive
                    and how do they keep themselves safe if doing so? And how do we know this is actually making people feel
                    more comfortable?
                    </p>

                    <h4> So what next? </h4>
                    <p>
                        For Norwich Craft Beer Week 2018, we’ll be working with the fantastic pubs involved, hosting seminars to let those who have
                        to deal with uncomfortable conversations, remarks and attitudes in a public facing work environment
                        and share their experiences (and horror stories) of pub culture. We’ll be asking staff to offer examples
                        of having dealt with difficult customers, where they’ve found things successful and unsuccessful,
                        and what they love and love less about the job they do. We want this to be a cathartic experience
                        that allows bar staff to articulate some of the harder parts of being in the service industry, to
                        connect people in similar jobs to empower a community of workers and to make visible a particular
                        set of working conditions and skills that are so often undervalued, both ideologically and fiscally.
                        We can’t wait to hear what our Norwich pub community has to say on this subject and encourage other
                        cities to take on this kind of action so workers feel safe, empowered and united against the discrimination
                        that we all want to fight. And with happy working environments, punters will enjoy a happier, safer
                        drinking space! If you have any questions or want to share your own insights, then do get in touch
                        with us on Facebook and twitter, we’d love to hear from you. Peace and solidarity, FEM.ALE Brewster
