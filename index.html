                        FEM.ALE is a festival that showcases female led music and most importantly, beer brewed by women and enjoyed by everyone.
                        Surprisingly, FEM.ALE is the first dedicated brewster festival in the U.K providing a platform to
                        celebrate women in the beer industry through extensive lists of female brewed beer, meet-the-brewers,
                        specially made one-off ales, panels, discussions and all sorts of other events.
                    </p>
                    <p>We get asked a few questions on a regular basis – sometimes from people with genuine inquiries or wanting
                        clarification, sometimes from people being snarky because… well, that’s what you get for pointing
                        out gender inequality.
                    </p>

                    <h4> What counts as a Brewster beer? </h4>
                    <p>
                        All the beers at FEM.ALE are designed, developed and brewed by women or brew teams that are led by women. Most of the breweries
                        we source from are pretty small, so it’s easy to define who’s doing the brewing, as opposed to other
                        jobs such as the accounts or the marketing. At some of the bigger beer companies, it’s harder to
                        tell who’s at the heart of the physical brewing process and the creative design process, so we go
                        to the women in those organisations and ask them what beers they’ve been involved with or which they
                        would recommend in the line-up of beers at the brew co. they work at.
                    </p>

                    <h4> What’s the difference between ‘craft beer’ and ‘real ale’? </h4>
                    <p>
                        Technically, not a lot. Or at least it depends on where you are. As a cultural phenomenon, craft beer emerged out of smaller
                        batch American breweries in the 1990s and 2000s, Sierra Nevada being a brand that used ‘craftiness’
                        to offer an alternative beer identity to those at big beer co’s like Coors or Budweiser to huge commercial
                        success. Here in the UK, thanks to CAMRA and the tireless work of thousands of brewers creating quality
                        small batch beer, real ale breweries were always sort of…doing that anyway. However, while the American
                        term ‘craft’ refers to the smaller volume of beer being produced, over here ‘craft’ refers more to
                        the style. ‘Craft beer’ is often keg bound than barrel aged, is therefore fizzier and stronger American
                        hops are used, giving American style craft beers a different, more pronounced hop flavour than ‘real
                        ale’ does with our slightly less sun-drenched British-grown hops. Rain cloud emoji.
                    </p>
                    <h4> Where are all the women in cider-making?? </h4>
                    <p>
                        We’re working on it!
                    </p>

                    <h4> Are men allowed at the festival (hurr hurr)? </h4>
                    <p>
                        Yes (hurr hurr). We welcome all genders to the party.
                    </p>

                    <h4> Is the beer… different? </h4>
                    <p>
                        Different… to what? If you’re a regular beer drinker, you’re probably already drinking Brewster beers on a regular basis.
                        Our plan is to bring a selection of them together to celebrate women in an industry where we are
                        largely underrepresented.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our unofficial Nottingham Craft Beer Week opening ceremony. Live music from female-fronted David Bowie tribute with a few
                        unique twists. Miss Bowie and the New Killer Stars aim to do justice to the genius of David Bowie&#39;s
                        music with authentic and heartfelt performances of their interpretations of his songs, at the same
                        time as paying homage to the original versions. Lead vocalist Jane Roberts says &ldquo;We are pretty
                        sure David would have approved [of a female singer], his whole ethos on androgyny, boundary shattering,
                        and (most importantly) on love, is something very close to our hearts.&rdquo; Free entry. Drinks
